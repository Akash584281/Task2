# Task2
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and important features of the dataset through statistical summaries and visualizations. The analysis starts by loading and cleaning the datasetâ€”removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are generated to describe numerical attributes. Visual tools like histograms, boxplots, countplots, heatmaps, and pairplots are used to uncover insights about passenger survival in relation to features like age, sex, class, fare, and embarkation point. Key findings indicate that females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates, while those who paid higher fares were more likely to survive. The analysis helps identify correlations and outliers, and builds a foundation for further predictive modeling tasks.
